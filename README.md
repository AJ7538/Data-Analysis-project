# Data-Analysis-project
All the files created during my Live project with Finlatics which covers the concept of using python and how to implement python in Data Analysis
I have attached 3 capsules in which each capsule covers one aspect followed by the last final project which was carried out on a Data set of youtube statistics, using pandas which allowed me to import the csv file and matplotlib.pyplot to create figures which show the output for tasks like finding average, median, mode, frequency, range, correlation etc
The python_files.zip file contains all programs for each question asked inside the analysis questions.docx file
