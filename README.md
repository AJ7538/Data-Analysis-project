# Data-Analysis-project
All the files created during my Live project with Finlatics which covers the concept of using python and how to implement python in Data Analysis
I have attached 3 capsules in which each capsule covers one aspect followed by the last final project which was carried out on a Data set of youtube statistics, using pandas whihc allowed me to import the csv file and carry out tasks like finding average, median, mode, frequency, range, correlation etc
